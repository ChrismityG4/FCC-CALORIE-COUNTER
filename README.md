#  CALORIE COUNTER - JAVASCRIPT ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURE

The 2nd build of of the Javascript course, again another steep leaning journey.  I decided halfway through this build to take a step away and do my own learning.

I was introduced to so many new coding concepts and it started to become overwhelming.  I know Iâ€™ll look back at this build in weeks to come and see how easy it is to understand but for now, it is taking some time to get my head around it.

With repetition the coding became easier to write and to understand, I really benefited from leaving it a few days to do my own study.  I watched videos, and completed steps of the FCC legacy course.  I really benefited from this as it solidified my understanding of what I was being asked to do.

All in all it was a challenge, frustrating at times but in the end I enjoyed the learning and building process.  I will continue to do my own study before embarking on the next build in the course.  I will also re-read and study the code from these first 2 builds to real cement in to understanding.

Thanks for reading,

Chris Smith
